# Objectives

## Legibility
Images are 8x8. Pixel art is a style with broad appeal, so I'm happy with how it looks at most sizes.

## Uniqueness
Identicons serve to differentiate users, similar usernames having similar identicons only serves to cause confusion.

## Appearance
### Color
I found a strategy to generate colors that work well together. Subjectively, I like the blocky pastels.
### Shape
Symmetry is the easy answer here. The human mind looks for patterns, and symmetry is one of the easier ones.

## Memorability
Not entirely distinct from Legability and Uniqueness, I think its important to pay particular attention to how easy it is to look at an image and recall having seen it before. I'm hoping that showing one color (the background) more prominently helps with this.

# Next Steps

I think its worth exploring replacing my "random pixels + symmetry" strategy with either clustering colors together, or 2-3 premade shapes with randomized offsets
